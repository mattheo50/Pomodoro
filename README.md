# Pomodoro

## Introdution

The project was an exercise from my BUT informatique of javascript, html and CSS where we have to develop a web application of a pomodoro, a system where you have to set up a work time and a break time and start a Chrono for working and after his time's up, the Pomodoro starts the break Chrono.

You can use here my [Pomodoro](https://mattheo50.github.io/Pomodoro/)

## How to use it

They are two ways to use it: 

### The simple way

An initial time is set: 25 minutes of working and 5 minutes of break
1. Turn on the Chrono with the play button
2. If you want to reset the session, you can press the reload button present in place of the play button

### The customary way

You can set a custom working time and break time
1. Custom your break and working time as you want with the range input (from 1 minute to 60 minutes)
2. Press the play button
3. If you want to reset the session, you can press the reload button present in place of the play button

## Credit

I want to thank all the people, including teachers and students, who helped me to develop this application, and W3Schools for the documentation.
